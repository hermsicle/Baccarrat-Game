## Rules
The rules for this game is pretty straight forward.
You have two options to choose from:
<ol>
    <li>Bet on Player</li>
    <li>Bet on Banker</li>
</ol>
In the game of Baccarat, tens count as 0. When you add up the values of the cards the final digit is what counts. For example, if the first two cards are 10 and 4 that counts as 4. When the first two cards total sum is less than 7, another card will be distributed to give you another chance of winning. 

<strong><em>The hand that comes closest to a total of 9 wins the round.</em></strong>
